# Solved-the-Traffic-Light-Problem
I was told to solve this problem and it wasn't explained to me well. After some time I realized that this was a simple problem that could have been easily solved using enum and the Switch cases.

The problem is that given the state of  a traffic light{True of False} depending on on the color it needs to output the same in case the condition is false or output the color to next sequence.

So a red with true will result in yellow.
   a yellow with false will result in the same color i.e yellow.
