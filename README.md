# Solved-the-Traffic-Light-Problem
Problem- Chnage in Lights from RED-YELLOW-GREEN in case of external TRUE/FALSE Factor.
The problem is that given the state of  a traffic light{True of False} depending on on the color it needs to output the same in case the condition is false or output the color to next sequence.

So a red with true will result in yellow.
   a yellow with false will result in the same color i.e yellow.
   
   The solution can be optimized but this is the basic structure.
